# Hugo 

This repo simply shows that having a `baseof.html` and `single.html`in the `layouts/_default` directory transforms `index.md` to html, but not `page1.md` or `page2.md` in the `content` directory to `html`.

## Version

```
hugo version
Hugo Static Site Generator v0.72.0/extended darwin/amd64 BuildDate: unknown
```

## Output

```
$ hugo
