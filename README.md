# Hugo 

This repo simply shows that having a `baseof.html` in the `layouts/_default` directory doesn't transform the `index.md`, `page1.md` or `page2.md` in the `content` directory to `html`.

## Version

```
hugo version
Hugo Static Site Generator v0.72.0/extended darwin/amd64 BuildDate: unknown
```

## Output

```
$ hugo
